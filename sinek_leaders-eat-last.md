# Leaders Eat Last

> By Simon Sinek

## Review

★★★★☆

Leaders Eat Last is a book about what it means to be a good leader, and how to
foster healthy, cohesive teams.

Overall I liked the book. I thought it offered good, consumable, convincing
ideas about what makes good teams work well together, and defined leadership as
a support, protection, and guidance role. It may be that I liked the book mostly
because it validated my own ideas of good teams and leaders in my professional
experience.

My only complaints are that it had the kind of shallow-ish feel-good tone that
you might find in a motivational self-help book: The ideas sound great and
plausible first, and supportive scientific evidence takes a back seat.

### The Bad

-   Too much military romanticism for my taste. I don't doubt that the military
    has many excellent examples of good team dynamics, but it was hard for me to
    relate to.
-   Arguments and ideas are appeal-to-emotion first, supported by evidence
    second.

### The Good

-   Competent, consumable writing. Fun to listen to, and easy to understand
-   Loved the definition of a good leader being a protector, serving and
    supporting the team, leader responsibilities of having power, but paying for
    that power by protecting the group. Fits my experience of good leaders.
-   Good explanations of how our brain's stress and reward systems interact to
    create selfish / selfless behavior (dovetails with ideas proposed about
    tribalism from _The Righteous Mind by @TODO_ p)

## Book Summary

### Main Ideas

-   Today's companies train managers but should be developing leaders
-   Additionally, companies (intentionally or otherwise) encourage short-term
    thinking and metrics, but should be considering long-term viability end
    people

### Part 1 - Our Need To Feel Safe

#### Chapter 1 - Protection from Above

-   Shares examples of good military leadership and platoon cohesion because
    best examples arise in stressful combat situations
-   Principles involved in leadership and teamwork in combat apply to business

#### Chapter 2 - Employees Are People Too

-   Great leaders don't consider people as means to grow money, but rather
    consider money means to grow people
-   If employees believe company puts people before money, people will repay in
    loyalty and drive to grow company
-   It is the leader's responsibility to protect the people, and in return, the
    people will protect themselves, and help grow the organization
-   On other hand, when leaders don't protect people, people become defensive,
    and protect themselves
-   _"... sacrifice the numbers to save the people, and not to sacrifice the
    people to save the numbers"_

#### Chapter 3 - Belonging

-   Circle of safety: Team's / individual's defenses to outside threats
-   World is filled with dangers. We evolved among natural threats like tigers,
    but today's threats are competitors, changing tech, meeting deadlines, etc.
    and are just as real
-   In bad orgs, threats include layoffs, bad cultures
-   When bad orgs present threats, people and teams become defensive, and act to
    protect themselves at cost of org
-   Duty of leader: create team culture free of threats and rich in camaraderie
-   Bad circle of safety = circle of threats: Layoffs, isolation, politics,
    shaming, intimidation, etc.
-   Good circle of safety: Belonging, protection, honesty, caring, etc.
-   Good circle of safety = team members free to effectively tackle threats to
    the organization

#### Chapter 4 - Yeah, but...

-   Idealism is nice, but many managers and employees stuck in bad orgs with bad
    cultures
-   Reality: Sales to make, mouths to feed
-   Pity many don't like their jobs because having job we hate is worse for
    health than having no job at all
-   Dangers of staying in bad job are worse than leaving

### Part 2 - Powerful Forces

#### Chapter 5 When Enough Was Enough

-   Do best work when facing external challenges, rooted in biology
-   Bad leaders believe internal threats are motivating which is not true

#### Chapter 6 E.D.S.O.

-   Four major chemical incentive for the body:
    -   Endorphins: Manages pain
    -   Dopamine: Feels good when accomplishing goal
    -   Serotonin: Makes you feel grateful for those who support you
    -   Oxytocin: Makes you feel love and is released when hugging or bonding
-   Serotonin & oxytocin backbone of circle of safety
-   Can't feel sense of responsibility towards numbers, we can only feel a sense
    of responsibility to people

#### Chapter 7 The Big C

-   Cortisol inhibits social chemicals, serotonin and oxytocin, and is released
    when under threat
-   When cortisol is released, we lack empathy, and have no drive to help each
    other
-   When in an environment where we don't feel safe, we naturally become more
    selfish for self-preservation
-   When social chemicals abundant, can even harness selfish chemicals to
    advance goals of organization

#### Chapter 8 Why We Have Leaders

-   Roles are not equal, and that's OK
-   Social hierarchies allow us to cooperate and have a shared understanding of
    order
-   Benefit of high status: Respect, can eat first, etc. Cost: must defend the
    group
-   Alpha males brimming with serotonin should be first to rush towards danger
    to protect the group
-   We give alphas first choice of mate because they're expected to die early,
    and we want to keep leadership genes in the group
-   We get angry when bad leaders are rewarded, e.g., large severance package.
    It's a violation of our expectations of a leader
-   Fame and financial status should be a byproduct of alpha status, not a way
    to achieve it
-   Rank is not what makes a leader. Leadership is the choice to serve others,
    with or without rank.
-   Those who want to enjoy perks of leadership w/o fulfilling obligations are
    weak leaders
-   True leaders are those who rise through ranks b/c they fulfil their
    obligations, and the tribe offers them higher status
-   Good leaders do right by their tribe in hard times: Their tribe commits to
    them to see them through

### Part 3 - Reality

#### Chapter 9 The Courage to Do the Right Thing

-   We trust people, not rules
-   Don't care about rules as long as leaders doing the right thing
-   Bureaucrats are annoying because rules should serve us, not other way around
-   When rules don't serve us anymore, there's no point in following them
-   _In strong organizations, people break rules for the benefit of the org, in
    weak orgs, people break rules for personal gain_

#### Chapter 10 Snowmobile in the Desert

-   Our limbic system (ancient brain) controls our feelings and ability to trust
    and cooperate
-   Our ability to cooperate allowed us to build complex and technologically
    advanced civilization
-   Ironic that current tech harms our ability to cooperate
-   Booming self-help industry evidence we're growing apart and more unhappy

### Part 4 - How We Got Here

#### Chapter 11 The Boom Before the Bust

-   The "Greatest Generation", c. WWII, selfless, about sacrificing to serve the
    whole
-   "Baby Boomers" beginning of selfish generation

#### Chapter 12 The Boomers All Grown Up

-   Disposable technologies took root with the baby boomers
-   Disposable tech -> disposable people (layoffs, et al.)
-   People have become abstractions: anonymous customers, lines on email list,
    expenses on spreadsheets
-   Culture of layoffs began w/ Reagan when layed off 11,000 air traffic
    controllers
-   Tacit approved layoffs in business world
-   Layoffs OK to serve numbers

### Part 5 - The Abstract Challenge

#### Chapter 13 Abstraction Kills

-   Milgram’s experiment: People more willing to harm when can't see victim
-   Experiment taking place on mass scale in business world
-   When people can't see victims, they're not real; They're abstractions
-   More distance = more potential harm b/c less consideration

#### Chapter 14 Modern Abstraction

-   Parallel between the famous Nazi defense of “I was just following orders” to
    the modern “we have to provide shareholder value” of corporate world
-   We are visual creatures. We help those we can see. We build what we can
    envision.
-   Issue: Pain / harm behind those we cannot see behind the abstractions
-   Can't see customers? Pursue metrics and KPIs
-   To justify any bad behavior: "Must serve shareholders", "have a fiduciary
    duty"
-   _"Provide shareholder value = I was following orders"_

#### Chapter 15 Managing the Abstraction

-   Rules to address dangers of abstraction:
    -   _Keep it real. Bring people together._ Trust is formed in-person, not
        over the internet
    -   _Keep it manageable: 150 people max._ Keep groups no larger than 150
        people to maintain sense of tribal belonging
    -   _Meet people you help._ Real, in-person contact w/ customers is
        rewarding and motivating
    -   _Give time, not money._ We value time more than money
    -   _Be patient. 7 days to 7 years._ Takes longer than 7 days but less than
        7 years to form bond of love and trust

#### Chapter 16 Imbalance

-   Destructive imbalance: social vs social pursuits
-   Destructive abundance = too much dopamine (goal accomplishment) too little
    oxytocin (social chemical)
-   Destructive abundance = getting results w/o caring how got there, focusing
    on final score and forgetting why we started
-   Destructive abundance brought on by weak leaders who don't fulfil their
    leadership obligations
