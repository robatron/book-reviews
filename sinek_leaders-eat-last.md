# Leaders Eat Last

> By Simon Sinek

## Review

★★★★☆

Leaders Eat Last is a book about what it means to be a good leader, and how to
foster healthy, cohesive teams.

Overall I liked the book. I thought it offered good, consumable, convincing
ideas about what makes good teams work well together, and defined leadership as
a support, protection, and guidance role. It may be that I liked the book mostly
because it validated my own ideas of good teams and leaders in my professional
experience.

My only complaints are that it had the kind of shallow-ish feel-good tone that
you might find in a motivational self-help book: The ideas sound great and
plausible first, and supportive scientific evidence takes a back seat.

### The Bad

-   Too much military romanticism for my taste. I don't doubt that the military
    has many excellent examples of good team dynamics, but it was hard for me to
    relate to.
-   Arguments and ideas are appeal-to-emotion first, supported by evidence
    second.

### The Good

-   Competent, consumable writing. Fun to listen to, and easy to understand
-   Loved the definition of a good leader being a protector, serving and
    supporting the team, leader responsibilities of having power, but paying for
    that power by protecting the group. Fits my experience of good leaders.
-   Good explanations of how our brain's stress and reward systems interact to
    create selfish / selfless behavior (dovetails with ideas proposed about
    tribalism from _The Righteous Mind by @TODO_ p)

## Book Summary

### Main Ideas

-   Today's companies train managers but should be developing leaders
-   Additionally, companies (intentionally or otherwise) encourage short-term
    thinking and metrics, but should be considering long-term viability end
    people

### Part 1 - Our Need To Feel Safe

#### Chapter 1 - Protection from Above

-   Shares examples of good military leadership and platoon cohesion because
    best examples arise in stressful combat situations
-   Principles involved in leadership and teamwork in combat apply to business

#### Chapter 2 - Employees Are People Too

-   Great leaders don't consider people as means to grow money, but rather
    consider money means to grow people
-   If employees believe company puts people before money, people will repay in
    loyalty and drive to grow company
-   It is the leader's responsibility to protect the people, and in return, the
    people will protect themselves, and help grow the organization
-   On other hand, when leaders don't protect people, people become defensive,
    and protect themselves
-   _"... sacrifice the numbers to save the people, and not to sacrifice the
    people to save the numbers"_

#### Chapter 3 - Belonging

-   Circle of safety: Team's / individual's defenses to outside threats
-   World is filled with dangers. We evolved among natural threats like tigers,
    but today's threats are competitors, changing tech, meeting deadlines, etc.
    and are just as real
-   In bad orgs, threats include layoffs, bad cultures
-   When bad orgs present threats, people and teams become defensive, and act to
    protect themselves at cost of org
-   Duty of leader: create team culture free of threats and rich in camaraderie
-   Bad circle of safety = circle of threats: Layoffs, isolation, politics,
    shaming, intimidation, etc.
-   Good circle of safety: Belonging, protection, honesty, caring, etc.
-   Good circle of safety = team members free to effectively tackle threats to
    the organization

#### Chapter 4 - Yeah, but...

-   Idealism is nice, but many managers and employees stuck in bad orgs with bad
    cultures
-   Reality: Sales to make, mouths to feed
-   Pity many don't like their jobs because having job we hate is worse for
    health than having no job at all
-   Dangers of staying in bad job are worse than leaving

### Part 2 - Powerful Forces

#### Chapter 5 When Enough Was Enough

-   Do best work when facing external challenges, rooted in biology
-   Bad leaders believe internal threats are motivating which is not true

#### Chapter 6 E.D.S.O.

-   Four major chemical incentive for the body:
    -   Endorphins: Manages pain
    -   Dopamine: Feels good when accomplishing goal
    -   Serotonin: Makes you feel grateful for those who support you
    -   Oxytocin: Makes you feel love and is released when hugging or bonding
-   Serotonin & oxytocin backbone of circle of safety
-   Can't feel sense of responsibility towards numbers, we can only feel a sense
    of responsibility to people
