# Leaders Eat Last

> By Simon Sinek

## Review

★★★★☆

Leaders Eat Last is a book about what it means to be a good leader, and how to
foster healthy, cohesive teams.

Overall I liked the book. I thought it offered good, consumable, convincing
ideas about what makes good teams work well together, and defined leadership as
a support, protection, and guidance role. It may be that I liked the book mostly
because it validated my own ideas of good teams and leaders in my professional
experience.

My only complaints are that it had the kind of shallow-ish feel-good tone that
you might find in a motivational self-help book: The ideas sound great and
plausible first, and supportive scientific evidence takes a back seat.

### The Bad

-   Too much military romanticism for my taste. I don't doubt that the military
    has many excellent examples of good team dynamics, but it was hard for me to
    relate to.
-   Arguments and ideas are appeal-to-emotion first, supported by evidence
    second.

### The Good

-   Competent, consumable writing. Fun to listen to, and easy to understand
-   Loved the definition of a good leader being a protector, serving and
    supporting the team, leader responsibilities of having power, but paying for
    that power by protecting the group. Fits my experience of good leaders.
-   Good explanations of how our brain's stress and reward systems interact to
    create selfish / selfless behavior (dovetails with ideas proposed about
    tribalism from _The Righteous Mind by @TODO_ p)
