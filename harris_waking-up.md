## WIP: Review

★★★★★

Waking Up by Sam Harris is a book about the nature of consciousness, and how we
don't need religion to better understand ourselves and the world we experience.

I loved this book. It's one of the most interesting and engaging books I've
read. I found myself highly engaged and interested. Harris presents his ideas in
an articulate and consumable way, which is impressive given the abstract and
symbolic nature of consciousness and "scientific spirituality".

## WIP: Summary

### Main Ideas

-   It is possible to live a good, fulfilling, moral way of life without
    subscribing to an indoctrinated set of beliefs.
-   Spirituality means a fundamental state of consciousness without the illusion
    of ego
-   We should stop thinking in terms of pleasure and pain, or that we area
    single, rational being. We should focus on being more mindful of our
    thoughts and feelings to understand our true selves
