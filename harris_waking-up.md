## WIP: Review

★★★★★

Waking Up by Sam Harris is a book about the nature of consciousness, and how we
don't need religion to better understand ourselves and the world we experience.

I loved this book. It's one of the most interesting and engaging books I've
read. I found myself highly engaged and interested. Harris presents his ideas in
an articulate and consumable way, which is impressive given the abstract and
symbolic nature of consciousness and "scientific spirituality".

## WIP: Summary

### Main Idea

It is possible to live a good, fulfilling, moral way of life without subscribing
to an indoctrinated set of beliefs.
