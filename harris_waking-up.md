## WIP: Review

★★★★★

Waking Up by Sam Harris is a book about the nature of consciousness, how "I" is
an illusion, spirituality is a scientific matter, and how meditation (and
perhaps psychedelics) can be a powerful tool to explore and understand one's own
mind.

I found this book profoundly interesting and engaging. I love learning about
consciousness and the human mind. Harris presents his ideas in an articulate and
consumable way, which is impressive given the mysterious, abstract, and symbolic
nature of consciousness.

## WIP: Summary

### Main Ideas

- It is possible to live a good, fulfilling, moral way of life without
  subscribing to an indoctrinated set of beliefs.
- _Spirituality_ means a fundamental state of consciousness without the illusion
  of ego
- We should stop thinking in terms of pleasure and pain, or that we are a
  single, rational being. We should focus instead on being more mindful of our
  thoughts and feelings to understand our true selves

### Key Idea #1: Seeking Pleasures And Avoiding Pain Will Not Result In Happiness

- All feelings, including feelings of pleasure, are fleeting. Even if you
  experience absolute pleasure or bliss, the feeling will fade, prompting you to
  chase another new moment of pleasure
- Imagine you're enjoying a long-awaited day at the beach. The feeling of sun on
  your skin is wonderful, but then you begin to sweat, so you seek a new
  pleasure: shade. Then a cool breeze makes you a little too cold, so you seek
  the warmth of your shirt, but you notice it's tattered, and you begin to
  desire a new one. And so it goes...
- Pleasures and pains depend on our perceptions of reality. E.g., the pain of
  working out can be "good". Clearly **there is more to happiness than seeking
  pleasure and avoiding pain.**

### Key Idea #2: Although We See Ourselves As A Single Unified “self” This Is Not The Case.

- What are you really? Who is "I"? Most assume sense of self is a single entity
  that exists in the brain, the observer of reality, and the originator of
  thoughts.
- We are not the thinkers of our thoughts, and our sense of control over them is
  an illusion. Even when trying not to think any thoughts, thoughts appear in
  our consciousness uninvited.
- The idea of a single self is an illusion. The brain is composed of different
  hemispheres, each with its own personality. We know this because people who
  have had a _colostomy_, a medical procedure which severs the connection
  between the hemispheres, demonstrate widely different traits depending on
  which hemisphere is stimulated. (See _split brain experiments_.)
- One famous _split brain experiment_ was of a young split-brain patient who was
  asked what he wanted to be when he grew up. His left hemisphere replied "a
  race car driver", and the other replied "a draftsman.
- Clearly we overestimate our control over our own thoughts, and as a result,
  lend them more power than is warranted. What can we do to overcome their power
  and gain perspective?

### Key Idea #3: Becoming “mindful” Of Our Thoughts And Worries Can Help Us Overcome Their Power Over Us.

- Try this: Observe your thoughts for a while. Where do they wander? Do you
  think about the past or the future?
- It's natural to brood on the past or think about the future, but is this
  really in our best interest?
- Our lives are often unsatisfactory because we spend so much time worrying
  about what has or what might happen instead of living in the moment.
- When you woke this morning, you likely experienced lingering negative thoughts
  that made you unhappy, like worrying about the huge workload you have.
- The problem isn't the worries themselves, but rather that you identify with
  those worries, and they are overwhelming. When experiencing these negative
  feelings, you don't think, "I am experiencing these feelings", you think
  instead, "things are bad, and there's no escape".
- But there _is_ escape: You can use the meditative technique _mindfulness_ to
  separate your thoughts and worries from yourself.
- When you meditate, you become aware of the contents of your consciousness,
  your impressions and thoughts. As you become aware of them, you can recognize
  that **your thoughts don't represent reality, but rather, they are constructs
  of your mind.**

### Key Idea #4: Meditation Is The Process Of Increasing Your Awareness, Which Allows You To See That Your Thoughts Are Just Passing Impressions.

- How do you influence mindfulness? One way is meditation.
- Start by closing your eyes and focusing on your breathing slowly and
  purposefully. As much as you try thoughts will almost certainly arise.
- As thoughts arise, acknowledge them, and return focus to your breath. Being
  mindful of your thoughts and feelings without letting them take over allows
  you to recognize that they are separate from your consciousness.
- Research indicates a connection between mindfulness and the realization that
  we are not a single "self".
- Research shows our mind wanders about 50% of the time. During these periods of
  wistfulness, the _default mode network_ (DMN) becomes more active.
- The DMN is partly responsible for our tendency to think about and judge
  ourselves. This is the root of our concept of "I", a single thinking entity.
- However, when we are focused on something, like during meditation, the DMN
  activity is reduced, and we stop thinking about ourselves. Experienced
  mediators weaken the DMN's influence even outside of meditation.

### Key Idea #5: There’s A Slow Approach And An Immediate Approach, That Both Lead To The Realization That “I” Is An Illusion; Take The Fast Route.

- Two types of approaches to meditation: _gradual_ and _sudden realization_
- _Gradual_ approach traced back to earliest forms of Buddhism, Theravada
  Buddhism.
- Theravada Buddhists conceptualized _selflessness_, i.e., the rejection of the
  single, thinking self, as being the end of a very long road
- Paradox in seeking the _goal_ of selflessness b/c goals require thinking of
  self
- _Sudden realization_ approach popularized by Dzogchen Buddhism
- Start with the premise that self is an illusion
- Of two approaches, _sudden_ is better for dismissing concept of self
- The author spent a considerable amount of time with the _gradual_ approach and
  never achieved selflessness, but he was able to do so with the \*sudden
  realization approach

### Key Idea #6: Spirituality Is An Empirical Matter, And Not A Religious One.

- Colloqually, spirituality is closely tied to religious thought, but
  spirituality and religion have little to do with each other.
- **_Spirituality_ means to induce non-ordinary states of conciousness**. People
  often turn to religion for this, but efforts to seek spirituality can be done
  through meditation or psycadellics
- Religeous schools of thought are unable to credibly claim their brand of
  spirituality is the only kind
- There are many different kinds of spiritual experiences, e.g.,
  self-transcending love, bliss, ecstasy, or “inner light,” which are common
  among all types of believers (Christians, Muslims, Jews, etc.), as well as
  non-believers
- Religous organizations cannot _all_ hold a monopoly on spirituality
- Despite contridictions, Westerners have difficulty separating spirituality
  from religion because spirituality in Western religions are faith-based
- Spiritual experiences can be achieved through prayer, but they are attributed
  to the religion of the prayer.
- On the other hand, Eastern religions are empirical at their core, as oppose to
  faith-based. They are concerned with observations and experiences of reality
- Meditation is a set of instructions. Belief in Buddhism is not required.
- Even the enlightened Siddhartha Gautama, the primary figure in Buddhism, was a
  man who simply awoke from the dream of being a separate self, and never made
  any claims of divinity

### Key Idea #7: Choose Your Gurus Carefully.

- Path to mindfulness will likely require the help of an experienced guide, but
  finding the right instructor is not easy
- It can be difficult to assess the quality or talent of spiritual guides
  because their talents are not obvious
- If you want a good golf instructor, it's easy to see their skill, but it is
  nearly impossible for a spiritual instructor to demonstrate their skill
- This fact makes it easy for charlatans to exploit the student-teacher
  relationship
- If your golf instructor suggested you shave your head or renounce sex, you'd
  find a new one, but these requests are not uncommon for a spiritual teacher
- Abandoning your illusion of self puts you in a very vulnerable position. E.g.,
  if your instructor asked you to undress, he could easily explain away your
  discomfort as your ego's resistance to detaching itself from your body
- Finding a teacher is important, but do your research

### Key Idea #8: If You Decide To Use Drugs On Your Path To Spirituality, Be Careful.

- Most people can testify the temporary change in consciousness brought on by
  drinking alcohol, e.g., the feeling of confidence or aggression
- This modification in consciousness is even more extreme with psychedelic
  drugs, e.g., MDMA induces piece of mind and raises your empathy towards others
- Other psychedelic drugs like LSD or mushrooms offer even more radical changes
  departures from everyday experiences. These profound and novel experiences can
  open you up to a whole new conception of what is possible in terms of
  consciousness
- These drugs offer the benefit of altered consciousness, but come with risks,
  e.g., MDMA may be neurotoxic
- These drugs are also unpredictable, and can lead to profoundly uncomfortable
  or frightening experiences
- These drugs must be handled with extreme care
